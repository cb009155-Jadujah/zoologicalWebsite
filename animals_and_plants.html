        <h1>Animals</h1>
        <p>The zoo is home to a wide range of native and exotic animals, including mammals, snakes, birds, and fish, many of which are intended for a miserable and torturous existence. Every year, the zoo shares some of its animals with other zoos around
            the world to increase the diversity of its collection and add new species. We are constantly attempting to add to their animal selection by introducing new participants.</p>
        <p>There are some of the zoo's most well-known species right now.</p>

        <h2>Mammals</h2>
        <p>They are rodents with hooves on their paws. They are known as even toed mammals (Artiodactyla) or odd toed mammals (Artiodactyla) based on the number of hooves (Perisodactyla).</p>

                <p>Visitors are immediately captivated by a herd of Chapman's Zebras at the zoo's entrance (Equus burchelli antiquorum). Visitors take advantage of the opportunity to pose for a selfie in front of the zebra exhibit, where they can see the
                    Zebra family galloping, hopping, and feeding. A baby Zebra has been born at the Dehiwala Zoological Gardens after 17 years. Thousands of people have flocked to the Dehiwala Zoo to see this baby Zebra. In the year 2008, the Zebra pair
                    was imported from China. The birth of the new Zebra baby has increased the number of Zebras at the Dehiwala Zoo to five.</p>

                <img src="images/elephants-dehiwala-zoo.jpeg" alt="elephants-animalPage">
                <p>Elephants from Africa (Loxodonta africana) and Asia (Elephas mammia) live in various parts of the world. Both animals can be seen at the Dehiwala Zoo. Six Asian elephants and one African elephant share the room. Elephants' educational
                    exhibition is open to the public every evening and is free of charge. Asian elephants are generally smaller than African bush elephants and have the largest body point on the head. The back is either convex or flat. The ears are narrow
                    and have folded dorsal borders. It may have up to 20 pairs of ribs and 34 vertebrae in the caudal region.The feet have five nail-like structures on each forefoot and four on each hind foot, which are more than those of African elephants.
                    Unlike the African elephant, which has a flat front, the African elephant's forehead has two hemispheric bulges.</p>
            </section>

            <h3>Birds</h3>
            <p>The zoo is vibrantly colored by a diverse array of bird species. Beautiful parrot species, flightless birds, aquatic and semi-aquatic birds, and many other aerial birds can be included in the bird section.
            </p>

            <section>
                <p>Flamingos normally stand on one leg and tuck the other under the body. The explanation for this behavior remains a mystery. Given that they spend a lot of time wading in cool water, one hypothesis is that standing on one leg helps the
                    birds to retain more body heat. However, the behavior can also be seen in warm water and in birds that do not normally stand in water. Another idea is that standing on one leg saves energy by reducing the amount of muscle effort needed
                    to stand and balance on one leg. A research on cadavers found that the one-legged pose could be maintained without any physical movement, whereas living flamingos move much less in a one-legged stance. Flamingos will stomp their webbed
                    feet in the mud to stir up food from the bottom, in addition to standing in the water.

                <p>Macaws are a species of New World parrot with long tails and bright colors. While many species in the wild are threatened with extinction, they are common in aviculture and as companion parrots. Macaws are distinguished from other parrots
                    by their proportionately larger beaks, long tails, and comparatively bare, light-colored medial (facial patch) areas. In members of the genus Anodorhynchus, the facial patch is often narrower and restricted to a yellow patch across
                    the eyes and a second patch at the base of the beak. The pattern of a macaw's facial feathers is as distinctive as a fingerprint.</p>

                <p>Lovebirds are 13 to 17 cm (5 to 7 in) long, have a wingspan of up to 24 cm with a single wing of 9 cm, and weigh 40 to 60 g (1 12 to 2 oz). They have a stocky body, a short blunt tail, and a relatively large, pointed beak, making them
                    one of the smallest parrots. Depending on the breed, wildtype lovebirds are mostly green with a range of colors on their upper bodies. A conspicuous white ring surrounds the eyes of Fischer's lovebirds, black-cheeked lovebirds, and
                    masked lovebirds. Many color mutant varieties have been created by selective breeding of common aviculture species.

            <p>Our zoo has many reptile creatures.</p>

                <img src="images/anacondaBabies.jpeg" alt="anaconda babies">
                <p>In 2008, the green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), which was brought to Sri Lanka with a male of the genus five years ago, gave birth to 23 baby anacondas in the Dehiwala Zoo, with 20 of them surviving. It was a very unusual occurrence for
                    a captive animal to give birth, particularly in a new environment. The zoo's current animal breeding program is beneficial for increasing the population of certain animal species in the zoo, as well as for global protection of endangered
                    species.

                    The Indian cobra is a medium-sized snake with a wide body. The relatively large and spectacular hood of this cobra species, which it extends when attacked, makes it easy to identify. A hood mark can be seen on certain specimens. The rear of the Indian
                    cobra's hood bears this hood mark. Two circular ocelli patterns are bound by a curved line when the hood mark is present, evoking the picture of spectacles. Throughout its habitat, the Indian cobra exhibits a wide range of color and
                    pattern. The underside coloration of this species' ventral scales may be grey, yellow, tan, purple, reddish, or black. The Indian cobra's dorsal scales may have a hood mark or color patterns.A posteriorly convex light band at the level
                    of the 20th to 25th ventrals is the most typical apparent pattern. On the dorsal scales, salt-and-pepper speckles can be seen, particularly in adult specimens. Specimens from Sri Lanka, in particular, may have poorly defined banding
                    on the dorsum.
