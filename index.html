                    <h2>Bio Diversity</h2>
                    <p>Plants and animals are at the heart of what we think of when we think of "environment." Plants are the cloth that protects the soil from the elements. They keep the soil in place, preventing erosion and enhancing water quality. Plants
                        provide both food and shelter for animals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wild animals, such as birds, fish, insects, and pollinators, are essential to a healthy ecosystem's network of activity. To conserve biodiversity, municipalities around the world have taken measures to incorporate biodiversity conservation into their
                        urban planning processes and zoning decisions.

                    <h2>Srilanka With Nature</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka is a flora and fauna haven. Sri Lanka holds the title of having the world's oldest recorded wildlife preserve. A area in north central Sri Lanka was set aside by royal decree more than 2000 years ago, in the 3rd century BC, to be free of all
                        hunting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka's virgin forests are abundant in flora and fauna, with a wide range of species. Elephants, leopards, bears, buffalo, and peafowl, as well as tree species such as ebony, mahogany, satinwood, and teak, are among the wildlife.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are main 4 divisions and 3 sub divisions of plants in Srilanka.They are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pteridophyta</li>
                        <li>Cycadophyta</li>
                        <li>Pinophyta</li>
                        <li>Anthophyta</li>

                    <h2>Dehiwala Zoo</h2>
                    <p>The National Zoological Gardens, also known as the Dehiwala Zoo, is a 30 acre well-landscaped zoo with a diverse array of birds, reptiles, fish, and mammals. One of Asia's oldest zoos is the Dehiwala Zoo. The zoo was founded as a menagerie
                        in the twentieth century by John Wickramasinghe, the brother of renowned animal trainer and dealer Carl Wickramasinghe. The 11-acre plot of land was used as a collection point for animals destined for Europe at the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For several decades, the Dehiwala zoo has served as an iconic attraction, especially for young children who look forward to visiting this beloved zoo. For several years, this is where the popular elephant dances and shows have taken place, a sight that
                        many have learned to enjoy. Large crowds of families arrive at the zoo with plenty of food and drink, as their children run around looking at the curious animals up close. When it comes to school children's outings, the zoo has
                        become the preferred destination, as they all line up patiently but obediently. They are given fun ice cream cones, which they happily consume. It is a place where parents and their children can spend meaningful time together while
                        learning about various animal species.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Dehiwala National Zoo has a fantastic array of exotic and native animals. Due to breeding and free-living bird colonies, the overall number of animals at Dehiwala Zoo ranges from 2500 to 3000. Dehiwala Zoo is well-known among tourists
                        not only for its range of local and exotic species, but also for its lush greenery landscaping. By good animal welfare, the Zoo encourages and facilitates conservation by breeding rare and endangered animals.</p>
                    <p>The species in this zoo can be divided into three categories. They are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mammals</li>
                        <li>Birds</li>
                        <li>Reptiles</li>
